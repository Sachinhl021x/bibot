# BIBot - AI-Powered Chat Application with RAG Functionality and Agent Interface

## 1. Project Overview
BIBot is an AI-powered chat application and agent workflow that allows users to interact with different language models (OpenAI's GPT and Anthropic's Claude) and utilize Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for enhanced, context-aware responses. The application features a user-friendly main interface with a main chat area, customizable sidebar for model selection and file management, and an artifact view for displaying different code generated by LLM. 

The main interface will also have an agent button. When users click this button, they will be taken to the agent interface, which allows users to upload Business Requirements Documents (BRDs) to generate Python and SQL code by calling an LLM. Users can view the generated code and download the BRD with the generated code included.

## 2. Key Features

### 2.1 Chat Interface
- Support for multiple AI models (OpenAI and Claude)
- RAG functionality for context-aware responses
- File upload and management for RAG
- Recent chat history
- Artifact display for additional information or code snippets

### 2.2 Agent Interface
- Uploading BRD documents
- LLM response observation viewing option
- UI to add more test cases or give additional instructions for the models
- View generated Python and SQL code
- Download BRD with generated code included

## 3. Technical Architecture

### 3.1 Frontend
- Built with React.js
- Key Components:
  - App.js: Main component managing state and layout
  - Sidebar.js: Handles model selection, RAG options, and file management
  - ChatInterface.js: Displays chat history and input field
  - ArtifactView.js: Shows additional information or code snippets
  - AgentInterface.js: Manages the agent workflow for BRD processing
  - CodeViewer.js: Displays generated Python and SQL code
  - BrdDownloader.js: Handles downloading BRD with generated code

### 3.2 Backend
- Built with Node.js and Express.js
- Key functionalities:
  - Chat processing with different AI models
  - File upload and storage in AWS S3
  - RAG implementation using LangChain
  - Conversation history storage in DynamoDB
  - BRD processing and code generation

### 3.3 External Services
- AWS S3 for file storage
- AWS DynamoDB for conversation history and agent workflow data
- OpenAI API for GPT model
- Anthropic API for Claude model

## 4. Data Flow

### 4.1 Chat Interface Data Flow
1. User inputs message in the chat interface
2. Frontend sends request to backend
3. Backend processes request:
   - If RAG is enabled, retrieves relevant information from uploaded documents
   - Sends prompt to selected AI model (OpenAI or Claude)
4. AI model generates response
5. Backend saves conversation to DynamoDB
6. Frontend receives response and updates chat interface
7. If applicable, artifact view is updated with additional information

### 4.2 Agent Interface Data Flow
1. User uploads BRD document
2. Frontend sends BRD to backend
3. Backend stores BRD in S3 and processes it using LangChain
4. Backend calls LLM to generate Python and SQL code based on BRD
5. Generated code is sent back to frontend and displayed in CodeViewer
6. User can view generated code and download BRD with included code

## 5. RAG Implementation
1. Users upload documents which are stored in S3
2. Documents are processed and embedded using LangChain:
   - Text is extracted from various file formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
   - Text is split into chunks using LangChain's text splitters
   - Chunks are embedded using a suitable embedding model (e.g., OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002)
3. Embeddings are stored in a vector database (e.g., Pinecone or Faiss)
4. When RAG is enabled for a chat:
   - The user's query is embedded using the same embedding model
   - Similar chunks are retrieved from the vector database using cosine similarity
   - Retrieved chunks are included in the prompt sent to the AI model
5. The AI model generates a response considering both the user's query and the retrieved context

## 6. Agent Interface Implementation

### 6.1 BRD Processing
1. Implement a BRD parser using LangChain's document loaders and text splitters
2. Create a custom LangChain agent for code generation:
   - Define agent goals: understanding BRD, generating Python/SQL code
   - Create custom tools for code generation and requirement analysis
3. Implement a code generation pipeline:
   - Extract requirements from BRD
   - Generate high-level pseudocode
   - Refine pseudocode into Python and SQL code

### 6.2 Result Management and Download
1. Implement a result aggregator that combines:
   - Original BRD
   - Generated Python and SQL code
2. Create download functionality:
   - Use a library like docx-templates or pdfkit to generate Word or PDF documents
   - Implement a template system for consistent formatting

## 7. Project Structure (for JavaScript implementation)
