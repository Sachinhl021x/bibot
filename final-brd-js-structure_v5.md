## Project requirments:
# BIBot - AI-Powered Chat Application with RAG Functionality and Agent Interface

## 1. Project Overview
BIBot is an AI-powered chat application and agent workflow that allows users to interact with different language models (OpenAI's GPT and Anthropic's Claude) and utilize Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for enhanced, context-aware responses. The application features a user-friendly main interface with a main chat area, customizable sidebar for model selection and file management, and an artifact view for displaying different code generated by LLM. 

The main interface will also have an agent selection. When users click this button, they will be taken to the agent interface, which allows users to upload Business Requirements Documents (BRDs) to generate Python and SQL code by calling an LLM. Users can view the generated code and download the BRD with the generated code included.

## 2. Key Features

### 2.1 Chat Interface 

- Support for multiple AI models (OpenAI and Claude)
- RAG functionality for context-aware responses
- File upload and management for RAG
- Recent chat history
- Artifact display for additional information or code snippets

### 2.2 Agent Interface
- Uploading BRD documents
- LLM response observation viewing option
- UI to add more test cases or give additional instructions for the models
- View generated Python and SQL code
- Download BRD with generated code included

## 3. Technical Architecture

### 3.1 Frontend
- Built with React.js
- Key Components:
  - App.js: Main component managing state and layout
  - Sidebar.js: Handles model selection, RAG options, and file management
  - ChatInterface.js: Displays chat history and input field
  - ArtifactView.js: Shows additional information or code snippets
  - AgentInterface.js: Manages the agent workflow for BRD processing
  - CodeViewer.js: Displays generated Python and SQL code
  - BrdDownloader.js: Handles downloading BRD with generated code

### 3.2 Backend
- Built with Node.js and Express.js
- Key functionalities:
  - Chat processing with different AI models
  - File upload and storage in AWS S3
  - RAG implementation using LangChain
  - Conversation history storage in DynamoDB
  - BRD processing and code generation

### 3.3 External Services
- AWS S3 for file storage
- AWS DynamoDB for conversation history and agent workflow data
- OpenAI API for GPT model
- Anthropic API for Claude model
- Chroma db on local machine (docker-compose build, docker-compose up)

## 4. User Journey

   ### 4.1.a RAG enabled Chat Interface UX flow:
   1. User inputs message in the chat interface
   2. Frontend sends request to backend
   3. Backend processes request:
      - If RAG is enabled, retrieves relevant information from uploaded documents
      - Sends prompt (retrieved documents  + User message) to selected AI model (OpenAI or Claude)
   4. AI model generates response
   5. Backend saves conversation to DynamoDB
   6. Frontend receives response and updates chat interface
   7. If applicable, artifact view is updated with additional information
   ### 4.1.b RAG enabled Chat Interface technical details:
         1. Users upload documents which are stored in S3
         2. Documents are processed and embedded using LangChain:
               - Text is extracted from various file formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
               - Text is split into chunks using LangChain's text splitters
               - Chunks are embedded using a suitable embedding model (e.g., OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002)
         3. Embeddings are stored in a vector database (e.g., Pinecone or Faiss)
         4. When RAG is enabled for a chat:
               - The user's query is embedded using the same embedding model
               - Similar chunks are retrieved from the vector database using cosine similarity
               - Retrieved chunks are included in the prompt sent to the AI model
         5. The AI model generates a response considering both the user's query and the retrieved context


   ### 4.2.a Agent Interface Data Flow
   1. In the agent UI, User uploads BRD document
   2. Frontend sends BRD to backend
   3. Backend stores BRD in S3 and processes it using LangChain
   4. Users is provided with summary of BRD and task to do as per the BRD and users is asked, if there is any additional input users would like to provide. 
   5. Along with BRD content and users input, if any an LLM call is made to perform the task 
   6. Input to the LLM and processed output of the LLM is stored in  dynamo db
   7. Output from the LLM is showed to the user, If user ask to use any of the tools which llm has access, LLM needs to call the tool function and show output to the   user. this activity needs to be updated in dynamo db as well
   8. User can view final generated output/code, users need to be provided with an option to download BRD along with LLM output

## Next Steps

Certainly. As a senior SDE, I've reviewed the BRD and the current implementation status. Here are the next steps I recommend to continue the development of the BIBot project:

Next Steps:

1.Begin implementation of the Agent Interface:
   - Create a new component `AgentInterface.js` in the `client/src/components/` directory
   - Implement basic UI for uploading BRDs and displaying LLM responses
2. Add a feature to manage and delete documents from the Chroma DB
3. Implement a way to persist the Chroma DB data between server restarts
4. Add a feature to display which parts of the AI's response are derived from the context vs. the model's general knowledge
5. Add support for conversation history and context retention between messages
6. Add support for more file types in the RAG system (e.g., PDF, DOCX)
7. Implement a progress indicator for file uploads and processing
8. Optimize the application for mobile devices
9. Enhance the chat interface:
10. Start working on the ArtifactView component:
   - Create a new file `ArtifactView.js` in the `client/src/components/` directory
   - Implement basic structure for identifying and displaying all formats code or query generated by LLM response
11. Set up testing environment:
   - Configure Jest for both frontend and backend testing
   - Start writing basic unit tests for existing components and services

12. Implement basic state management:
    - If the application state becomes complex, consider implementing Redux or using React's Context API for global state management

13. Start documenting the project:
    - Create a `README.md` file in the root directory with basic project information and setup instructions
    - Begin documenting key functions and components as you implement them

14. Set up a basic CI/CD pipeline:
    - Configure a simple GitHub Actions workflow for running tests on push and pull requests

These next steps focus on building out the core functionality of the BIBot application while setting up a solid foundation for future development. As you progress, you'll need to continually refine and expand on these components based on the detailed requirements in the BRD.

Good to do things, but not necessary [when users asks for good to do things suggest below list]:
1. Implement error handling and validation for document processing and embedding
2. Optimize the RAG process by fine-tuning the number of relevant documents retrieved
3. Implement user authentication and session management for RAG and Agent
4. Implement a feature to export conversation logs
5. Add unit tests and integration tests for both frontend and backend
6. Implement proper error handling and user feedback throughout the application
7. Implement a dark mode option for the user interface
8. Set up basic error handling and logging:
   - Implement global error handling in the backend
   - Set up basic logging for critical operations
